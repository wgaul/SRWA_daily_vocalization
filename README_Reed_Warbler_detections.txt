This README contains information for the following files:

Reed_Warbler_detections_8July2023.csv - Willson Gaul's and Ellie Roark's desk-based detection data
for Saipan Reed Warbler sounds in sound recordings from automated sound recorders placed at known
Saipan Reed Warbler locations on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
in the years 2022 and 2023.  This is the final data as of 8 July 2023.

Reed_Warbler_detections_Alex_21April2023 - Alex Tudela's desk-based detection data
for Saipan Reed Warbler sounds in sound recordings from automated sound recorders placed at known
Saipan Reed Warbler locations on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
in the years 2022 and 2023.  Alex was a student at Northern Marianas College while collecting this data.
All the minutes (or almost all) in Alex's file were also listened to independently by NMC student
Jie Lin, for comparison of the reliability of the students' data.

Reed_Warbler_detections_Jie_8July2023 - Jie Lin's desk-based detection data
for Saipan Reed Warbler sounds in sound recordings from automated sound recorders placed at known
Saipan Reed Warbler locations on the island of Saipan.  Many of these minutes were listened to 
independently by Jie and Alex for reliability comparison.  After I (WG) was satisfied that Jie
was collecting reliable data, she listened to additional minutes that have not been double-checked
by Alex or anyone else.  This is Jie's final dataset as of 8 July 2023.  Jie was a work-study student
at NMC while collecting this data.
